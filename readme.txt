1. FeatureProcessing.ipynb is used to do feature processing to generate TF*IDF representation of documents and perform LSI to do dimension reduction. The final output is the LSI features of samples.
2. tficf.py is used to compute TF*ICF and find the 10 most significant terms in the required classes.
3. LinearSVM.ipynb is used to perform classification by SVM method and calculate confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier.
4. soft-marginsvm.ipynb is used to perform classification by soft-margin SVM method and calculate confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier.
5. NaiveBayes.ipynb is used to perform classification by naive bayes method and can plot and ROC curve and calculate confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier.
6. LogisticRegression.ipynb is used to perform classification by logistic regression method and can plot and ROC curve and calculate confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy, recall and precision of the classifier.
7. MultiClass.ipynb is used to perform multi-class classification by naive bayes and multi-class SVM method and calculate confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy, recall and precision of the classifiers.
8. plotHist.ipynb is used to plot histograms.
9. data directory contains all LSI features.
